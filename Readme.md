# GJK_tester
GJK visualizer project for DH2323

This is a Unity 2020.3.32f1 project, making use of the GJK collision detection algrithm here https://github.com/frilel/CLCollision.

Open the scene "GJK Visualizer", every active object with a "mesh collider" from CLCollision and a mesh containing vertices will be tested every frame when pressing play. In scene view one can then move around the objects to see how the objects turn red when intersecting and lines between the closest points on non-intersecting objects.
